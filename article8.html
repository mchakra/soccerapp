    <p> Real Madrid were coming off of a season where they steamrolled to a La Liga title and also won the Champions League in the same season, so they were expecting to continue that run of domiance going 
        into next season. In case you previously didnt know, they signed Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint Germain on a free transfer, thus making him THE marquee signing that year. While a lot
        of people were clamouring over the trio of Mbappe, Vinicius Jr, and Rodrygo, they failed to improve their midfield and defense, thus leading to an underwhelming start by the clubs
        lofty expecatations. They sit 2nd in La Liga and are 3-0 down to Arsenal on aggegrate. However, there was a lot of chirping in the lead up to the match on Tuesday.

        There were multiple tweets online, including the club's media, fans, even the players and social media admins joined in on the chirping. They even posted on twitter asking 
        Chat GPT to translate the phrase "90 minutes at the Bernabaeu is a long time." 
     </p>   
        
     <p>
        And did Real Madrid back that up? 
     </p>
       Well, after a lackluster opening, Real Madrid commited a foul during 
        an Arsenal corner, leading to a queestionable penalty, in which Buyako Saka absolutely scuffed it. Nevertheless, Real got a penalty of their own in equally controversial fashion.
        However, this was interesting as the VAR officals took 5 MINUTES to make the decision. From the 22nd minute to the 27th we would get squabbles about what would happen with the call. The penalty was not given, and
        that lead to Real looking absolutely toothless in attack. However, their defensive fraility would be put on display in the 2nd half as Saka scored to make it 4-0 on aggegrate and practically ending 
        the tie. However, a minute later, Real would catch a break where William Saliba hesitated for a back pass and Vinicius would tap it into an empty net.

    <p>
        AND WITH THAT, REAL MADRID FINALLY HAVE THEIR PUSH IN THEIR QUEST FOR LA REMONTADA!!!!!!!!!!
    </p>

    <p>
        Or so they thought, as their attacking incomptence would show again as they struggled to break down a low block that Arsenal had set up. In the dying minutes of the match,
        Arsenal sends a long ball forward, Garbiel Martinelli runs onto it, and with a 1v1 vs Courtious, he converts to put the tie beyond doubt, making it 5-1 to Arsenal, and sending the Gunners
        through to the Champions League Semi Finals, while Real were dumped out in the most hilarious fashion.

    <p>
        All week long, the fans, media, players, and the club were chatting nonstop in the lead up to the match about a "different mentality" and a "comeback", only to play pathetic 
        football for 180 minutes. Their supposed "superteam" were outplayed by an overall underwhelming Arsenal team. Let us relish in this joy, as the Evil Empire in white falls, 
        in hilarious fashion, to a team with 0 Champions League titles.
