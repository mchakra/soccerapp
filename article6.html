    <p>Manchester United eliminated from the FA cup 5th round at home vs Fulham. </p>

    <p>Manchester United are having an abysmal season. They are 14th in the league in March, out of the League Cup, and now out of the FA cup, with their only hope for the season 
        being against Real Socidedad in the Europa League. The author is loving every second of it, as the Red Devils fall again in the FA cup to Fulham on penalties. However, it is important
        to note that Manchester United were the current FA cup holders, having their previous manager, Erik Ten Hag, somehow defeat local rivals Mancester City to win the tournament.

    <p>Well, that being said, for those of you unaware, Manchester United fired him after they were 15th after 7 games, and instead of doing the sensible thing and keeping a manager
        that knows the ins and outs of the club and peformed admirably in his 2 matches in charge, they decided to spend 10 million to bring in Rubin Amorim from Sporting CP in Lisbon.
        Sooner rather than later, that turned out to be a disaster, as Manchester United got even worse than before, as they are now 15th in March. This is their worst season in 40 years.
        And now, after a Calvin Bassey goal in a drab first half, followed by Bruno Fernandes rescuing them from the brink of elimination, Joshua Zirkzee waved good bye to his own fans 
        after he missed his penalty alongside Victor Lindelof, which were both saved by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno.
