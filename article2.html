    <h1>Champions League: Real Madrid's late magic downs Manchester City again </h1>
<p>It's becoming a regular theme in recent years in the business end of the UEFA Champions League: Real Madrid coming back from what appeared to be certain defeat to stun mighty Manchester City. 

    On Tuesday in England, the defending European champs and record 15-time winners of soccer's most prestigious club competition once again roared
     back from a second-half deficit to win, taking a 3-2 aggregate lead in their two-leg, home-and-home, total-goals-wins series with a place in the round of 16 at stake. </p>

     <p>Real-City was the undisputed headliner of this new playoff round, but there were three other matches around the continent on Tuesday. These are the big takeaways. </p>

     <p>For all the talk about Real Madrid's magic in this tournament, the cold reality is that Los Blancos probably boasts the best collection of players on the planet. 
        That still doesn't explain how Real Madrid consistently manages to come back from the dead in Champions League play against Pep Guardiola's side, perhaps the only
         club in the world whose squad can match theirs man-for-man. </p>
